Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies.


The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

For example: 

if the shift is 3, then the letter A would be replaced by the letter D, B would become E, C would become F, and so on. The alphabet is wrapped around so that after Z, it starts back at A.


         H becomes K (shift 3 from H)


         E becomes H (shift 3 from E)


         L becomes O (shift 3 from L)


         L becomes O (shift 3 from L)

         
         O becomes R (shift 3 from O)


The encrypted message is now “KHOOR”.
